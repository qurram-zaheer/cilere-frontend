# Client side

### Requirements:

- Node.js `v14.4.0`
- Yarn `v1.22.4`

You may install Yarn [from here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#debian-stable)

## Setup

> You must have the server running locally first before the client can function as required. Please clone the server repository [here](https://github.com/qurram-zaheer/cilere-backend), navigate into it, and run `yarn` followed by `yarn start`
>
> I would like to apologize for not being able to host the server, all of the free hosting services kept hibernating it and turning it off, so running it locally was the most reliable way I could think for doing this.

1.  Clone this repository and navigate into it
2.  Install the required packages by running `yarn`
3.  Run the application with `yarn start`, you should see the application open in the browser at `localhost:3000`
